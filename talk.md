Learn Rails they said. It's easy they said. I experienced me learning Rails as everything but easy. It seemed that with every step I was slapped in the face with a new gem, exception or a whole new programming language. "You should really use Javascript for that." ... and off I went to Codecademy to follow their JavaScript track. Even though I was surrounded by some great mentors, some days just looking at Avdi's Objects on Rails made my stomach cringe.

In my talk I'd like to share my learnings, being confident with Rails after starting learning programming in the evening hours August last year. I'd like to offer the coders attending a different view on what is too self-evident for them to adapt their vocabulary. I strongly believe teaching makes you a better programmer and (in my case) teaching makes your own learning curve go through the roof.

Hi. My name is Floor Drees and 

#####Start with the basics
HTML and Markdown helps to create a proper understanding of constructing decent syntax
Codecademy fucking rocks
So does Codeschool

#####JavaScript will continue to suck (better dig into it fast)
Don't be fooled by CoffeeScript's popularity

#####Don't get started with Bootstrap till you have a decent understanding of CSS (or the Rails View for that matter)
Less
boost your confidence

#####BDD rocks for beginners

#####Get to learn the lingo
Listen to RubyTapas, RubyRogues, even if you understand fuck of what they're saying. Pause 

#####Ask a co-worker or friend to be your mentor

#####Don't fake it till you make it.
Don't fool your mentor

#####Start teaching others right away
Rails Girls
PyLadies

#####Learn a different language simultaneously (in the same language)

#####



###The downs

#####Ignore the people that hate on your parade
Prepare for lousy jokes from brogrammers


###The ups

#####Prepare to be amazed by people putting a lot of time in making kick-ass tutorials

#####Through Ruby, I have developed a more logical and efficient way of problem solving
