Learn Rails they said. It's easy they said. I experienced me learning Rails as everything but easy. It seemed that with every step I was slapped in the face with a new gem, exception or a whole new programming language. "You should really use JavaScript for that." ... and off I went to Codecademy to follow their JavaScript track. Even though I was surrounded by some great mentors, some days just looking at Avdi's Objects on Rails made my stomach cringe.

In my talk I'd like to share what I've learned, being confident with Rails after starting learning programming in the evening hours August last year. I'd like to offer the coders attending a different view on what is too self-evident for them to adapt their vocabulary. I strongly believe teaching makes you a better programmer and (in my case) teaching makes your own learning curve go through the roof.

Hi. My name is Floor Drees. Two years ago I exchanged Rotterdam for Vienna to work at a startup that does 'stuff' with reviews and is **not** called Yelp. I had worked as a community manager for agencies and startups for 5 years, and here I'd make a little step up, becoming head of community management (notice the 'head of'? That addition is not there for swag reasons alone, I actually managed a team). Partly because I had been doing more or less the same thing over and over for years, ie community management, because I wanted to 'make stuff' again (I have a background in design) and because I worked closely together with the developers there, I decided I wanted to pick up on something new. That something new was learning to program. As this startup's stack used Ruby on Rails, there was no real decision process here on what language I'd be learning. Cool thing is that many of my developer coworkers had coached at Rails Girls events, and I was familiar with their program. I started going though their courses, in August last year, supported by Sebastian Graessl. Later 

#####Start with the basics
HTML and Markdown helps to create a proper understanding of constructing decent syntax
Codecademy fucking rocks
So does Codeschool

#####JavaScript will continue to suck (better dig into it fast)
Don't be fooled by CoffeeScript's popularity

#####Don't get started with Bootstrap till you have a decent understanding of CSS (or the Rails View for that matter)
Less
boost your confidence

#####BDD rocks for beginners

#####Get to learn the lingo
Listen to RubyTapas, RubyRogues, even if you understand fuck of what they're saying. Pause 

#####Ask a co-worker or friend to be your mentor

#####Don't fake it till you make it.
Don't fool your mentor

#####Start teaching others right away
Rails Girls
PyLadies

#####Learn a different language simultaneously (in the same language)

#####Controlling everything from the Terminal makes you feel like you're in the fucking matrix
(this is a good thing)

#####Developers saying that something is 'super easy' while to you it looks like the hardest thing in the world, just need a nudge in the right direction.
I understand it though. It's probably the same with me telling my mum over the phone (while being in a busy tram with eager eavesdroppers) how to make something 'fat' in Word... Funny thing with my mum is that she's actually a vivid user of Twitter (follow her on @toosdreef) and Facebook. At one point I figured that explaining her how to open a link I had sent in an email was similar to crafting a new tweet on Tweetdeck. "Just select the link (she thinks clicking it will hide her email inbox forever), copy it, paste it in a new browser tab like you'd use a new tweet field, and hit enter!" Worked. 

#####It's not all dorm rooms and cold pizza
GitHub provides the social component might it otherwise be absent


###The downs

#####Ignore the people that hate on your parade
Prepare for lousy jokes from brogrammers

#####Imposter syndrom
"If you read the Linux Kernel Mailing list, you’d assume that all open source projects are ruled by critical neckbeard overlords, and that submitting a bug fix or enhancement could possibly result in ego-crushing attack against your person if your code wasn’t good enough. It kept me a little reticent to contribute unless I was 100% sure what I was doing was correct.

Looking at the easy-to-browse issues and pull requests on GitHub, I realized most open source projects aren’t like that, and that most people welcome your contributions, and even if they aren’t happy with what you’ve done, the feedback is generally given very gracefully.

Moreover, the idea that I had in my head was that all popular open source projects have perfectly readable and maintained code, that all of these open source maintainers somehow have godly skills that far exceed yours. That crumbles very quickly in reality. When I’m searching for a library that does a particular task, thank to GitHub’s simple code-browsing, I look at the source and issues of almost everything I’m evaluating before I use it. You see a variety of skills and code quality. To fix things, you see ugly hacks. And you realize, you’re just as good as anyone else."

###The ups

#####Prepare to be amazed by people putting a lot of time in making kick-ass tutorials

#####Through Ruby, I have developed a more logical and efficient way of problem solving
