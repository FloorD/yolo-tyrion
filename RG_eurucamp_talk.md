Learn Rails they said. It's easy they said. I experienced me learning Rails as everything but easy. It seemed that with every step I was slapped in the face with a new gem, exception or a whole new programming language. "You should really use JavaScript for that." ... and off I went to Codecademy to follow their JavaScript track. Even though I was surrounded by some great mentors, some days just looking at Avdi's Objects on Rails made my stomach cringe.

Hi. My name is Floor Drees. Two years ago I exchanged Rotterdam for Vienna to work at a startup that does 'stuff' with reviews and is **not** called Yelp. I had worked as a community manager for agencies and startups for 5 years, and here I'd make a little step up, becoming head of community management (notice the 'head of'? That addition is not there for swag reasons alone, I actually managed a team). Partly because I had been doing more or less the same thing over and over for years, ie community management, because I wanted to 'make stuff' again (I have a background in design) and because I worked closely together with the developers there, I decided I wanted to pick up on something new. That something new was learning to program. As this startup's stack used Ruby on Rails, there was no real decision process here on what language I'd be learning. Cool thing is that many of my developer coworkers had coached at Rails Girls events, and I was familiar with their program. I started going though their courses, in August last year, supported by one of my coworkers. Little later my company supported me to work as a junior developer one day a week, mainly documenting bugs talking to marketing and communication, and actually fixing bugs. 

I organized Rails Girls Rotterdam in January, organizing [Rails Girls The Hague][4] in September, I co-organize the [Ruby user group meetups in Vienna][5] and the [PyLadies workshops in Vienna][6]. I currently work at [Usersnap][7] and spend the little time that is left coaching at Rails Girls events and helping out where I can when it comes to [Rails Girls Summer of Code][8].

I absolutely loved it, BUT... looking back on a year of learning I see things that I could have tackled a bit better. Like:

#####Start with the basics
REALLY learning HTML, Markdown and CSS helps one to create a proper understanding of constructing decent syntax. 
Codecademy fucking rocks and so does Codeschool, so this really shouldn't be a problem. 

#####JavaScript will continue to suck (better dig into it fast)
JavaScript is just hard, the syntax is weird and complicated and it doesn't 'read' like HTML or Ruby. 
It was also hard not be fooled by CoffeeScript's popularity and end up figuring out which failing CoffeeScript line corresponded with which JavaScript line. 

#####Don't get started with Bootstrap till you have a decent understanding of CSS (Inspect ALL the elements)
Being able to create a decent looking website or just know how a website is build up by looking at it, really boosts your confidence. Plus, playing around with HTML and CSS allows you to view your changes in the browser instantly, learning while you go.
Like what you see? Then it's time to dive into stuff like Less. Else, slap a bootstrap on that sucker. 

#####BDD rocks for beginners
During a Ruby beginners course I introduced working with cucumber and rspec and thus step definitions building your application up from the ground. Cucumber is great, because it reads like a sales pitch or a feature briefing from/to a client. Everyone that can read English can follow what you're doing there. 

#####Get to learn the lingo
I noticed that listening to RubyTapas, RubyRogues, and the likes - even though I understood fuck of what they're saying 80 percent of the time - really worked for me. I'd pause the podcast everytime I wouldn't know a certain term, look it up on Google and continue. After a while I'd need to pause a whole lot less. 

#####Ask a co-worker or friend to be your mentor
I had the fortune of friends and coworkers helping me out. If you're shit outta luck here, I'd advise people new to programming to drop by a local user group. [rubyusergroups.org][1] has a quite up to date overview of user groups around, else [meetup.com][2] and [lanyrd][3] come in handy. Rather handle this stuff online? Fire up Twitter and research the #pairwithme hashtag to find someone who'd like to coach you or learn with you. 

#####Don't fake it till you make it.
Don't try and trick your coach into thinking you got it all figured out. Thing is, often times they'll just overwhelm us with their knowledge - and understandably so, they are after all psyched about this stuff - and if anything, that's demotivating. Rather than stopping the hands-on learning you got going on, you'll claim you know all about dependency injections. Now this requires some mind-reading on their side, which is hard. Or you just being honest. Else:

- You will feel stupid, and give up.
- You will Google stuff while your coach is having your toilet break, and get your ideas from questionable sites.
- You will starting putting even more evening hours in learning in an attempt to try to get to your coach's level and will burn out as a result.

#####Start teaching others right away
Teaching will accelerate your own learning. They will ask you things you'd otherwise take for granted. And you'll need to be able to actually explain it.
You can take it even more yolo and start organizing a Rails Girls event or PyLadies event in your city, forcing yourself to learn at least the basics - and get to know the community - before a certain deadline. 

#####Learn a different language simultaneously (in the same language)
This might sound a bit controversial, but it isn't really. I started learning Java right after I started learning Ruby. Now bear with me. I started going through a Java reader in German. I figured that working in a German speaking country, it would help learning terminology in German. It obviously didn't. First: there is simply less documentation on bugs and error messages in German. Second: Java is hard enough as it is, just stick to English already! 
Still I'd plea for learning two languages. Later I picked up on Python and it really allowed by to remember the languages' specifics by recognizing the differences and similarities in syntax. 

#####Controlling everything from the Terminal makes you feel like you're in the fucking matrix (this is a good thing)
Get familiar with the terminal as soon as possible. As soon as I started using the terminal to create my folders even for non-programming related projects, I started using version control for basically everything and I wouldn't break my workflow anymore when I needed to test stuff or push changes. I'd be in the terminal already.

###The downs

#####Ignore the people that hate on your parade
I wish I had known I'd need to be ready for lousy jokes from brogrammers. Whenever I shared a code snippet, an excerpt of a book or a ridiculous one-pager I had made, I'd hear hurtful stuff about focussing on 'what women are good at', how much of a hipster language Ruby supposedly is or how I should stick to social media stuff as I was too lightheaded to be a developer. I couldn't really tell these people how hurtful their comments were as they'd then claim they were just joking. Maybe they were, but they were certainly not funny.

#####Imposter syndrom
If you read Ruby weekly newsletter, or lurk around on the Ruby channel on IRC, you’d assume that all open source projects are ruled by ['critical neckbeard overlords, and that submitting a bug fix or enhancement could possibly result in ego-crushing attack against your person if your code wasn’t good enough'][9]. This is unfortunate as it will make you question your code. Instead, browsing issues and pull requests on GitHub, I soon realized most open source projects aren’t like that, and that most people welcome your contributions, even if it only fixes a typo.

#####Frontend vs Backend
This age-old frontend vs backend discussion is everything but inviting or welcomy. Quit it. On company level (create feature teams!) and in other developer projects. Rather encourage your student or students to aim for a close to allround developer-ship and (only) then specialize in your tools of choice, be it CSS or C.

#####Developers saying that something is 'super easy' while to you it looks like the hardest thing in the world, just need a nudge in the right direction.
I understand it though. It's probably the same with me telling my mum over the phone (while being in a busy tram with eager eavesdroppers) how to make something 'fat' in Word... Funny thing with my mum is that she's actually a vivid user of Twitter (follow her on @toosdreef) and Facebook. At one point I figured that explaining her how to open a link I had sent in an email was similar to crafting a new tweet on Tweetdeck. "Just select the link (she thinks clicking it will hide her email inbox forever), copy it, paste it in a new browser tab like you'd use a new tweet field, and hit enter!" Worked. 


###The ups

#####Prepare to be amazed by people putting a lot of time in making kick-ass tutorials, events and making conferences and user group meetups as inclusive as possible. 

#####Through Ruby, I have developed a more logical and efficient way of problem solving
Through Ruby (and programming in general), I have developed a more logical and efficient way of problem solving, more of an understanding of folder structures and generally lost any fear to ask questions. If I couldn't figure something out or get something to work, my mentors would encourage me to talk them through the problem. Through what I later found out is called rubber duck debugging - I often got to the root of the problem myself (often I just wasn't in the right folder or didn't update my roots), without having to turn to the internet for answers. 

#####It's not all dorm rooms and cold pizza
GitHub provides the social component might it otherwise be absent because you're studying by yourself, in the quiet of your bed room. Introducing GitHub as a 'social network for developers' proved to work with the Rails Girls attendees.It's soothing to know there are more people out there.

So... wrapping up, I guess it's all about:
- starting with the basics
- inspect ALL the elements
- digging into JavaScript asap
- getting into BDD 
- learning the lingo
- don't fake it (until you make it)
- learn a different language simultaneously
- use the terminal for everything
- ask a co-worker or friend to be your mentor
- start teaching others right away
