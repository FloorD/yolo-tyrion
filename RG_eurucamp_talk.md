Learn Rails they said. It's easy they said. I experienced me learning Rails as everything but easy. It seemed that with every step I was slapped in the face with a new gem, exception or a whole new programming language. "You should really use JavaScript for that." ... and off I went to Codecademy to follow their JavaScript track. Even though I was surrounded by some great mentors, some days just looking at Avdi's Objects on Rails made my stomach cringe.

In my talk I'd like to share what I've learned, being confident with Rails after starting learning programming in the evening hours August last year. I'd like to offer you coders a different view on what is maybe too self-evident for you to adapt your vocabulary. I strongly believe teaching makes you a better programmer and (in my case) teaching makes your own learning curve go through the roof.

Hi. My name is Floor Drees. Two years ago I exchanged Rotterdam for Vienna to work at a startup that does 'stuff' with reviews and is **not** called Yelp. I had worked as a community manager for agencies and startups for 5 years, and here I'd make a little step up, becoming head of community management (notice the 'head of'? That addition is not there for swag reasons alone, I actually managed a team). Partly because I had been doing more or less the same thing over and over for years, ie community management, because I wanted to 'make stuff' again (I have a background in design) and because I worked closely together with the developers there, I decided I wanted to pick up on something new. That something new was learning to program. As this startup's stack used Ruby on Rails, there was no real decision process here on what language I'd be learning. Cool thing is that many of my developer coworkers had coached at Rails Girls events, and I was familiar with their program. I started going though their courses, in August last year, supported by one of my coworkers. Little later my company supported me to work as a junior developer one day a week, mainly documenting bugs talking to marketing and communication, and actually fixing bugs. 

I absolutely loved it, BUT... looking back on a year of learning I see things that could have been tackled better. Like:

#####Start with the basics
REALLY learning HTML, Markdown and CSS helps one to create a proper understanding of constructing decent syntax. 
Codecademy fucking rocks and so does Codeschool, so this really shouldn't be a problem. 

#####JavaScript will continue to suck (better dig into it fast)
JavaScript is just hard, the syntax is weird and complicated and it doesn't 'read' like HTML or Ruby. 
It was also hard not be fooled by CoffeeScript's popularity and end up figuring out which failing CoffeeScript line corresponded with which JavaScript line. 

#####Don't get started with Bootstrap till you have a decent understanding of CSS (Inspect ALL the elements)
Being able to create a decent looking website or just know how a website is build up by looking at it, really boosts your confidence. Plus, playing around with HTML and CSS allows you to view your changes in the browser instantly, learning while you go.
Like what you see? Then it's time to dive into stuff like Less. Else, slap a bootstrap on that sucker. 

#####BDD rocks for beginners
During a Ruby beginners course I introduced working with cucumber and rspec and thus step definitions building your application up from the ground. Cucumber is great, because it reads like a sales pitch or a feature briefing from/to a client. Everyone that can read English can follow what you're doing there. 

#####Get to learn the lingo
I noticed that listening to RubyTapas, RubyRogues, and the likes - even though I understood fuck of what they're saying 80 percent of the time - really worked for me. I'd pause the podcast everytime I wouldn't know a certain term, look it up on Google and continue. After a while I'd need to pause a whole lot less. 

#####Ask a co-worker or friend to be your mentor
I had the fortune of friends and coworkers helping me out. If you're shit outta luck here, I'd advise people new to programming to drop by a local user group. [rubyusergroups.org][1] has a quite up to date overview of user groups around, else [meetup.com][2] and [lanyrd][3] come in handy. Rather handle this stuff online? Fire up Twitter and research the #pairwithme hashtag to find someone who'd like to coach you or learn with you. 

#####Don't fake it till you make it.
Don't fool your mentor

#####Start teaching others right away
Rails Girls
PyLadies

#####Learn a different language simultaneously (in the same language)

#####Controlling everything from the Terminal makes you feel like you're in the fucking matrix
(this is a good thing)


###The downs

#####Ignore the people that hate on your parade
Prepare for lousy jokes from brogrammers when 

#####Imposter syndrom
"If you read the Linux Kernel Mailing list, you’d assume that all open source projects are ruled by critical neckbeard overlords, and that submitting a bug fix or enhancement could possibly result in ego-crushing attack against your person if your code wasn’t good enough. It kept me a little reticent to contribute unless I was 100% sure what I was doing was correct.

Looking at the easy-to-browse issues and pull requests on GitHub, I realized most open source projects aren’t like that, and that most people welcome your contributions, and even if they aren’t happy with what you’ve done, the feedback is generally given very gracefully.

Moreover, the idea that I had in my head was that all popular open source projects have perfectly readable and maintained code, that all of these open source maintainers somehow have godly skills that far exceed yours. That crumbles very quickly in reality. When I’m searching for a library that does a particular task, thank to GitHub’s simple code-browsing, I look at the source and issues of almost everything I’m evaluating before I use it. You see a variety of skills and code quality. To fix things, you see ugly hacks. And you realize, you’re just as good as anyone else."

####Frontend vs Backend

#####Developers saying that something is 'super easy' while to you it looks like the hardest thing in the world, just need a nudge in the right direction.
I understand it though. It's probably the same with me telling my mum over the phone (while being in a busy tram with eager eavesdroppers) how to make something 'fat' in Word... Funny thing with my mum is that she's actually a vivid user of Twitter (follow her on @toosdreef) and Facebook. At one point I figured that explaining her how to open a link I had sent in an email was similar to crafting a new tweet on Tweetdeck. "Just select the link (she thinks clicking it will hide her email inbox forever), copy it, paste it in a new browser tab like you'd use a new tweet field, and hit enter!" Worked. 



###The ups

#####Prepare to be amazed by people putting a lot of time in making kick-ass tutorials

#####Through Ruby, I have developed a more logical and efficient way of problem solving

#####It's not all dorm rooms and cold pizza
GitHub provides the social component might it otherwise be absent
