####What I learned learning Rails 

Learn Rails they said. It's easy they said. I experienced me learning Rails as everything but easy. It seemed that with every step I was slapped in the face with a new gem, exception or a whole new programming language. "You should really use Javascript for that." ... and off I went to Codecademy to follow their JavaScript track. Even though I was surrounded by some great mentors, some days just looking at Avdi's Objects on Rails made my stomach cringe.

In my talk I'd like to share my learnings, being confident with Rails after starting learning programming in the evening hours August last year. I'd like to offer the coders attending a different view on what is too self-evident for them to adapt their vocabulary. I strongly believe teaching makes you a better programmer and (in my case) teaching makes your own learning curve go through the roof.
